# Privacy Policy for Hexagon Grid Overlay — Struktur Tribute

_Last updated: June 5, 2025_

## Overview

This Chrome Extension, **Hexagon Grid Overlay — Struktur Tribute**, is a minimalist visual enhancement inspired by the conceptual artist book *Struktur* (1968) by Nils Olof Bonnier. It overlays a purely client-side hexagonal grid on top of websites the user visits.

## Data Collection

We do **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal data. The extension:

- ❌ Does not track browsing activity
- ❌ Does not collect cookies or content from pages
- ❌ Does not transmit any data to external servers
- ❌ Does not use remote code or analytics

All functionality is self-contained and runs entirely in your browser.

## Permissions Justification

- `activeTab`: Only used to apply the overlay when the user interacts with the extension.
- `storage`: Stores whether the overlay is enabled or disabled between sessions (locally).
- `host_permissions: <all_urls>`: Needed to apply the overlay on any user-selected page.

## Changes to This Policy

If this extension ever changes to include new features that affect privacy, this policy will be updated accordingly and versioned.
