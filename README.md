# Hexagon Grid Overlay — Struktur Tribute

A minimalist Chrome Extension that overlays a conceptual hexagon grid pattern on all websites, inspired by *Struktur* (1968), the legendary artist book by Swedish conceptual artist **Nils Olof Bonnier**.

## 🌀 Concept

> "*Struktur*" was not just a visual artwork — it was a meditative pattern system, a reflection on repetition, rhythm, and the geometry of thought.  
> — This extension is a digital homage to that vision.

The overlay displays a uniform grid of transparent hexagons, mimicking the strict modular aesthetic Bonnier explored in the late 1960s. It’s both a visual enhancement and a conceptual nod to a lost voice in Swedish conceptual art.
